One of my favorite hobbies is listening to music! Thinking about it, I decided to create this music application, in which, in addition to the user being able to listen to his songs from anywhere and on any device, he can also register new songs!!

This app was made in React and Next.js, to improve the development I also used TypeScript and to store all the data Firebase.db was used
